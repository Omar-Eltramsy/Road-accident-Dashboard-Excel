## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of car accidents worldwide for the years 2021 and 2022. Utilizing powerful analytical tools and visualization techniques, this dashboard offers valuable insights into road accident data. The ultimate goal is to leverage these insights to contribute towards making roads safer.

## Skills showcased in this Project
  * Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
  * Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function. 
  * Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
  * Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
* Checking NULL values and Errors
* Creating 2 new colum 'Year' and 'Month' 
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key steps included:
* Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between different variables, such as weather conditions and accident severity.
* Trend Analysis: Examining how accident rates changed over the two-year period and identifying any seasonal patterns.
## Data Visualization
To effectively communicate the insights derived from the data, various visualization techniques were employed:
* Time Series Analysis: Line charts to show trends in accident rates over time.
* Geographical Analysis: Treemap to illustrate the distribution of casualties across different road surfaces.
* Categorical Analysis: Bar charts and pie charts to depict the distribution of accidents based on factors like vehicle type, weather conditions, and accident severity.

## Recommendations based on the Analysis
* By comparing casualty trends between 2021 and 2022 monthly, the dashboard identifies critical periods of Jan and Jun. The road safety measures by the traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods.
* Extra safety measures should be placed on Single-carriageway roads.
* Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential.
* Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during the daytime.
